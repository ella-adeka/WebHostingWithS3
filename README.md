# Simple Website Hosting With S3

A static website was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website was hosted on Amazon S3, and Amazon CloudFront was used as a content delivery metwprk for faster loading times.
Additionally (not necessary), Amazon Route 53 was used to configure a custom domain for the website.
